I am Saad Bencherif, co-founder and CPO of [Presti AI](https://presti.ai).

On this blog, I share what Iâ€™m learning along my entrepreneurial journey, with a focus on my passions: Product, AI and Entrepreneurship.

My startup Presti AI is a solution that empowers furniture companies to generate high-quality visuals using AI.

Presti, backed by [YCombinator (S24)](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/presti-ai) and Partech, [has raised $3.5 million to revolutionize AI product photography](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/presti-uses-generative-ai-to-improve-product-photography-in-the-furniture-industry/).

Before founding Presti, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at BCG Gamma and graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris.

My passion for entrepreneurship began during my internship at Glovo in 2017, in Barcelona.

I witnessed hyper-growth firsthand, with the team doubling in just five months. At 22, seeing 25-year-old CEO Oscar Pierre lead a skyrocketing company made me realize that building impactful businesses is within reach.
